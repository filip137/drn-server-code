# Teacher-initialized single-conductance ReRAM MNIST fine-tuning (10 epochs)

This exploratory control measures the original one-conductance-per-physical-
edge student after ReLU-teacher programming and exactly ten epochs of
measured-trace KL fine-tuning. It uses the registered
`mnist_relu_drn_kd.v1` experiment.

## Controlled setup

- Teacher: the same frozen bias-free `784 -> 50 -> 10` ReLU checkpoint used by
  the initialized differential run.
- Student: bias-free dual-rail `[1568, 100, 20]` DRN with one independently
  assigned measured cohort-A conductance per physical edge.
- Mapping: lift each signed teacher matrix into non-negative dual rails, search
  the same non-clipping layer-scale grid, map every target to the assigned
  device's affine trace range, and fit one positive readout gain on the same
  1,024-example calibration subset.
- Programming: begin each device at raw pulse-zero RESET, perform exactly one
  global-nearest teacher-target write, then project fine-tuning targets onto
  that assigned raw trace.
- Fine-tuning: pure `KL(teacher || student)`, seed 42, batch size 16,
  calibrated one-conductance learning rates `[2.1e-10, 5.7e-13]`, and exactly
  10 epochs.
- Circuit scaling: model-local logical indexing, `voltage_amp = 4`, and
  `current_amp = 0.25`.

The differential arm uses twice these learning rates because its effective
weight update is the difference of two branch updates. Thus the declared rates
are gradient-equivalent in the ideal-device limit.

## Interpretation boundary

This is the explicit ten-epoch replay of the measured one-conductance arm in
the earlier 20-epoch KD study. It is a matched control for the initialized
`G+ - G-` run in teacher, data, seed, solver, objective, calibration, device
cohort, amplification, and minibatch budget. The architecture-appropriate
initial mappings differ: one conductance uses its device-local affine trace
range, while a differential pair uses the two traces' shared reachable window.

## Result

The campaign completed from clean source commit
`c507dd9d13825721aa4e25c05f2303302c2a050c`. Both stages exited zero, the
training stream contains one initialization record followed by exactly ten
completed epochs, and no non-finite value or error marker was present.

The nominal teacher-map search selected scale fractions `[1.0, 0.125]`, with
calibration KL `0.00970462` and gain `0.630957` before measured programming.
After projection onto independently assigned device-local affine ranges, the
calibration KL became `2.24954` and the fitted gain hit its lower grid boundary
at `0.001`. The programming step therefore destroyed the useful direction of
the nominal teacher scores; this was not merely a uniform attenuation that a
positive gain could undo.

| Evaluation point | KL | Accuracy | Teacher agreement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mapped initialization, validation | 2.242688 | 8.10% | 8.12% |
| selected epoch 10, validation | 2.242688 | 8.16% | 8.16% |
| selected checkpoint, held-out test | 2.246097 | 7.98% | 7.81% |

The selected validation KL improved by only `1.23e-7` in absolute terms, a
relative recovery of `5.48e-8`; the declared 10% recovery gate failed. The
output-layer aggregate conductance statistics did not change, while the hidden
layer's mean conductance shifted by only `1.95e-11 S`. The clipped-small
readout gain also scales the KL gradient reaching the circuit, and almost all
shadow updates remained below the raw-trace projection resolution. Ten more
epochs in the earlier study did not alter that conclusion.

Training took `182.01 s`, and fresh-process evaluation of all 10,000 held-out
examples took `1.42 s`. The teacher itself reached `97.36%` test accuracy.

## Matched differential comparison

| Evaluation | One conductance | `G+ - G-` pair |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| initial validation accuracy | 8.10% | 89.12% |
| initial validation KL | 2.242688 | 0.231839 |
| selected validation accuracy | 8.16% | 97.42% |
| selected validation KL | 2.242688 | 0.0138965 |
| test accuracy | 7.98% | 97.48% |
| test agreement | 7.81% | 98.76% |
| test KL | 2.246097 | 0.0140905 |

The differential pair gains `89.50` percentage points of test accuracy and
reduces test KL by `99.37%`. Both arms use the same teacher, data, seed,
amplification, objective, solver, calibration set, minibatch count, and
gradient-equivalent learning rates. Their architecture-appropriate mapping is
the material distinction: per-device affine floors remain as unrelated terms
in the one-conductance dual rails, whereas the pair's shared reachable window
allows a local common component to cancel in `G+ - G-`.

This does not mean that one-conductance DRNs cannot learn. The corrected
from-RESET paired-MSE controls reached about `93.9%`; it means this particular
ReLU-to-independent-affine-device programming scheme destroys the teacher
signal and then locks KL fine-tuning near the uniform-output solution.

## Artifact integrity

Fresh validation reproduced model-local stages
`[(0, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 4, 0.0625)]`, teacher and device-source hashes, and the
two stable keys `base.dense_weight.0` and `base.dense_weight.1`. The selected
weights SHA-256 is
`1096560c3ce5d06b299948d9264caf32c6ea9d9e1dbfe8b6ba47a416047a5bfd`;
the exact epoch-10 resume SHA-256 is
`d90785dc326d5f78283b7e4df6b5ae25e6366277d18f9773c32223cbe857f806`.
The complete initialization and first-ten trajectory exactly match the earlier
20-epoch measured one-conductance run.
